<i>If you've ever watched Baby Reindeer, you'll know how much I can relate as you read this story.</i><br>

<h2 id="Year-2017"><a href="#Year-2017" class="headerlink" title="Year 2017"></a><font weight=900 color="palevioletred" face="arial">Year 2017</font></h2><p><font weight=580>I met him in 2017, 7 years ago, when I was 15 and Eminem’s album Revival was dropped. I was a crazy fan of Eminem at that time, so was he. He DM’d me on BiliBili, a Chinese video-sharing platform just like Youtube. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m just sooo excited that Eminem dropped his new album today, so I decide to find someone and buy them this album as a gift. I saw your comments under so many of his videos, so I think you’ll be the lucky one!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, as I just mentioned, I was crazy for Eminem so I left my comment under almost every one of his videos on Bilibili. Probably part of me saw this as a goal, a way to prove that I’d been there. You know, I came I saw I conquered. So obviously, that was how I attracted his attention.</p>
<p>I felt like I was blissed. Maybe a little exaggerated, but that was my first time winning anything just based on my luck. I added him on QQ, a Chinese messaging app with a funny name, especially if your’re French. Honestly, I thought he’d buy me a physical album, turned out it was just a digital one. But anyways, beggers can’t choose. Well, he also got me two months of premium membership for the music app, so shut up girl. </p>
<p>This is exactly what I thought at that time. Even though he only spent like 50 RMB, or £5.5, I thought ofc I couldn’t delete him straightly after this. Then, we started chatting. In the first evening, he already decided to share all of his traumas. According to him, he had always been a straight-A student till the big big entrance exam for high school. His grades could only got him into a vocational school, which is terribly dispised by us Chinese <i>(I’m sry)</i>. Ever since the result came out, his mom was crying all the day. His dad was furious that he chased him with a knife across several blocks. After that, he decided to lock himself in the bedroom without food or water for a whole week. He peed in the bottle if he had to.</p>
<p>It’s just easier to open up to a complete stranger, isn’t it, especially when they are paid or bribed by £5.5 to hear all this shit. But still, I didn’t delete him, cuz of his favor of one digital album and two-month premium membership. But I was 15, so I don’t think you can expect me to do too much with this.</p>
<p>We kept talking on and off for two weeks or so. Then he started to set this rule, REQUIRING me to reply him in five minutes. If I was unable to do so, I had to tell him in advance. Or else, there would be a big meaningless argument about how I wasted his time waiting for my reply. When did I ask him to wait tho? He just had some control issues and was unwilling to admit. </p>
<p>Things went on like this for another one month or two. Then this day came. I completely forgot about his messages that night, so when I realized I was scared cuz I knew what would happen: an hour long fight with no result but my sleep hour deprived. If you’re Chinese, you’ll know how life is like during high school; if you’re not, basically, we get up at 6:30 or earlier, sit in the classroom for 15 hours, and go to sleep after 12. First of all, how do you expect a busy-and-exhausted-af student to reply you at anytime; second of all, I need to sleep; third of all, WHO ARE YOU? </p>
<p>So I just decided to pretend that I fell asleep and reply him the next morning. Unfortunately, I forgot again the next day. So I just gave up, no reply anymore. I saw his messages continuously swarming in. Then two days later, he deleted me. One day later, my friend from junior high sent me a screenshot of that guy asking her: <i>Why isn’t she replying? Is she sick? Did she reply to you? Did she use QQ in the past three days?</i> Fucking sick. Think about it, how could he add my friend if he had deleted me? He was so prepared when he press the delete button. He probably wrote down every account that may know me well.</p>
<p>I told her to leave him alone. Since that day, he started to send me messages on every platform, BiliBili, the music app, and trying to add me on QQ using different accounts.</p>
